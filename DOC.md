The JavaScript AI Tic Tac Toe code is an implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe that can be played in two different modes: normal and against an AI.

The code starts by selecting elements from the HTML document that represent the game board, the locations on the board where X's and O's can be placed, and various buttons and containers used for the game.

Next, the code initializes various variables used for the game. mode and gameon are used to track whether the game is in normal mode or AI mode and whether the game is currently being played. player tracks which player is currently playing, with 1 representing the first player and 2 representing the second player. xo is an array that keeps track of which cells on the board contain X's and O's. players is an array that holds the two possible players: the AI and a human player. aiicon and humanicon are variables used to represent the symbols that the AI and human player use on the board.

scoress is an object that maps various game states to a score. helper, helper1, and helper2 are functions used to check whether a certain sequence of cells on the board contains a winning combination for the AI or human player.

drawxo is a function that updates the display of the board to show the current X's and O's in each cell. checkwin is a function that checks whether any player has won the game by checking if any of the winning combinations of cells have been filled with the same symbol. winner is a function that returns the winner of the game, depending on whether the last player to make a move was the AI or the human player.

The code sets up event listeners on each cell on the board, which are triggered when a cell is clicked. If the game is in normal mode, the code checks which player is currently playing and adds the appropriate symbol to the clicked cell. If the game is in AI mode, the code checks whether it is the human player's turn and adds the appropriate symbol to the clicked cell. If it is the AI's turn, the aimove function is called, which calculates the optimal move for the AI using the minimax algorithm and adds the AI's symbol to the appropriate cell.

The minimax function is used to recursively calculate the optimal move for the AI. It does this by simulating every possible move that the AI could make, and then simulating every possible move that the human player could make in response. It continues this process until a win or draw is detected, and then returns a score based on the outcome of the simulation.

Finally, the code contains various utility functions such as boardfull, which checks whether the board is full, and settext, which updates the text displayed to the user based on the current game state.
